# MJM Yacht Theme

> **Built By [@tjordanbenn](https://tjordanbenn.com) for [Cobble Hill](https://cobblehilldigital.com).**

## System requirements

You'll want to ensure you have the following already installed on your local machine before getting started:

- **Node:** The current LTS (long-term support) release. We like to use a Node Version Manager like [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

- **NPM 5+ or Yarn:** Both of these package managers have [ups and downs](https://blog.risingstack.com/yarn-vs-npm-node-js-package-managers/), choose whichever you prefer. Follow the installation instructions [for Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) or [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to make sure you're using the latest version.

## Getting started

Ensure that you have package.json and gulpfile.js. To ensure that the elements of the package.json file are up to date, check the versions numbers at [NPMjs](https://www.npmjs.com/).

This was built using [MAMP](https://www.mamp.info/en/) as the server.

To get started with this Theme, run the following

```
$ npm install
```

To run:

```
$ gulp
```
